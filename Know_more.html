            <h2>What is Banana Leaf Vegan Leather?</h2>
            <p>
                Banana leaf vegan leather is a groundbreaking and eco-friendly alternative to traditional animal and synthetic leathers. Made from the fibers of banana plants, this sustainable material offers a greener option for consumers who care about the environment.
            </p>

                <li><b>Treatment:</b> The fibers undergo a treatment process to enhance their durability, flexibility, and aesthetic appeal. This includes cleaning, softening, and dyeing.</li>
                <li><b>Weaving and Bonding:</b> The treated fibers are woven or bonded using non-toxic adhesives, creating durable and stylish sheets of vegan leather.</li>
            </ol>
